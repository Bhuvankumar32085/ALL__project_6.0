              <h1>What is an Article?</h1>
              <p>Articles—a, an, and the—are placed before nouns to specify whether the noun is being referred to in a general or specific way.
                Indefinite Articles: “A” and “An” are indefinite articles used to refer to something non-specific.
                Example: I saw a cat. (refers to any cat, not a particular one)
                Example: She is an engineer. (“an” is used because “engineer” starts with a vowel sound)
                Definite Article: “The” is used when talking about something specific or known to both the speaker and listener.

                  <!-- <p>Learning new things is fun, but for most students, it becomes dull because of the constant pressure to excel. And then there are special interests, journalism being one of them. Speaking of journalism, feature articles are a great way to explore this avenue. And feature article examples for students allow them to learn about a topic in a completely unique manner.</p> -->

                    <p>Teachers can have a lasting effect on our success later in life. We asked Heather Hill, the Hazen-Nicoli Professor in Teacher Learning and Practice at Harvard’s Graduate School of Education, what skills a good teacher possesses.
                        Most scholars would say that a good teacher does three key things: They establish strong, caring teacher-student relationships; challenge students to think, reason, and communicate their ideas; and convey subject matter accurately and clearly.  
                        Good teachers have strong knowledge of their students as individuals — how they think and think about themselves as learners — as well as of their students’ culture and community.
                        They not only understand the subject matter they teach; they understand it in ways that are particular to their work in a classroom. For instance, they know how to coordinate different definitions of fractions (as a part of a single whole object, as part of a set of objects, and as a point on number line) in ways that help their learners develop a robust understanding of the topic. In the fraction lesson, good teachers know to use Piaget’s theory of cognitive development — that the world becomes gradually more complex as students progress — and what mistakes students will make when solving one-half plus one-quarter.</p>
