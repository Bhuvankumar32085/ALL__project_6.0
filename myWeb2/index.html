                   <h2>Mobile phone</h2>
                   <p>A mobile phone, or cell phone,[a] is a portable telephone that allows users to make and receive calls over a radio 
                    frequency link while moving within a designated telephone service area, unlike fixed-location phones (landline phones)
                    . This radio frequency link connects to the switching systems of a mobile phone operator, providing access to the public
                     switched telephone network (PSTN). Modern mobile telephony relies on a cellular network architecture, which is why mobile
                      phones are often referred to as 'cell phones' in North America.</p>

                   <h2>laptop</h2>
                   <p>A laptop computer or notebook computer, also known as a laptop or notebook, is a small, portable personal computer (PC). 
                    Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor with a flat-panel screen on the inside of the upper lid and an alphanumeric 
                    keyboard and pointing device on the inside of the lower lid.[1][2] Most of the computer's internal hardware is in the lower 
                    part, under the keyboard, although many modern laptops have a built-in webcam at the top of the screen, and some even feature 
                    a touchscreen display. In most cases, unlike tablet computers which run on mobile operating systems, laptops tend to run on 
                    desktop operating systems, which were originally developed for desktop computers.</p>

                   <h2>CPU</h2>
                   <p>A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor, main processor, or just processor, is the primary processor in a 
                    given computer.[1][2] Its electronic circuitry executes instructions of a computer program, such as arithmetic, logic, controlling, 
                    and input/output (I/O) operations.[3][4][5] This role contrasts with that of external components, such as main memory and I/O 
                    circuitry,[6] and specialized coprocessors such as graphics processing units (GPUs).</p>

                   <h2>Graphics processing unit</h2>
                   <p>A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit initially designed for digital image processing and to 
                    accelerate computer graphics, being present either as a discrete video card or embedded on motherboards, mobile phones, personal 
                    computers, workstations, and game consoles. After their initial design, GPUs were found to be useful for non-graphic calculations 
                    involving embarrassingly parallel problems due to their parallel structure. Other non-graphical uses include the training of neural 
                    networks and cryptocurrency mining.</p>
